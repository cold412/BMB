                        Brewing art is rooted in the dark and ancient times. It has facilitated the development of
                        agriculture, the rise and fall of powerful civilisations and has, to a great extent, shaped of
                        the world as we know it. Brewing and fermentation played an immensely important social role and
                        were often seen as sacred physical manifestations of deities in old cultures. The most famous
                        deity is probably Dionysus - the god of wine and beer who could bring people pleasure, happiness
                        - or insanity. At Black Metal Brewery we continue this sacred ancient tradition, dedicatedly
                        performing rituals to bring the true spirit into our drinks so that you can enjoy the taste of
                        the dark magic. We provide real drinks of uncompromised quality for the fans of true metal,
                        folk, ancient history - and beyond.

                        The brewery - then without a brewing site except for own homes - was founded in 2012 in
                        Edinburgh, Scotland, by two old friends - metalheads and inspired brewers. Since those times
                        much has changed, except for the uncompromised quality, strength and character of the now
                        award-winning metal brews forged in Scotland. Currently blasting out mighty hectolitres on a
                        1000-litre system in Midlothian. We salute you, maniacs! Mighty Hails!
